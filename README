This is a quick and dirty example of how to use the inflection
server.  Note: it does string copies and prints strings without
checking lengths carefully and without verifying that the
characters are all printable.  However, the buffers are much
larger than the example prompts and replies, so there won't be
a problem unless you purposefully to cause one.

To try communication, use two computers.  You can choose two in
the Xinu lab, say xinu11.cs.purdue.edu and xinu12.cs.purdue.edu.

Use a separate window for each.  Fortunately, you will have the
same home directory across all machines, so the files are shared

On one computer type:

	./example_reg  UUUU  xxx yyy

where UUUU is your career account login, and xxx and yyy are arbitrary
strings (you can actually use xxx and yyy for the test).

On the other computer, type:

	./example_acc  UUUU  xxx yyy

where the arguments are *exactly* the same as above.

The two programs should contact one another, exchange messages,
and display the results.  You can try modifying the prompt in the
access message.  You can also register multiple services
simultaneously, such as running 


	./example_reg  UUUU  xxx serv1 &

	./example_reg  UUUU  xxx serv2

Then try accessing them.
